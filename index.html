        <h2>About the Artist</h2>
        <p>
          Meet Lorcan, an 18-year-old from Leixlip, Ireland, who's been drawing
          since he could hold a pen. While art holds a special place in his
          heart, he's equally enthusiastic about inventing captivating board
          games designed to keep you entertained for days on end. Currently,
          Lorcan is immersed in animation studies at Ballyfermot College Dublin,
          where he's refining his skills to bring his imaginative concepts to
          life. When he's not busy with his studies, you'll likely find him
          spending quality time with friends and family, brainstorming ideas for
          his next gaming venture, or sketching out new characters. Feel free to
          explore Lorcan's vibrant world of art and gaming by visiting his
          website. It's where his creativity truly comes to life.
